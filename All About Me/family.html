            <h1>My Family</h1>
            <h3>My family is an interesting bunch. Here's a list of the people I live with:</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Abinav - My Bro
                    <br/>
                    <img src="img/abinav.png" alt="abinav"/>
                    <br/>
                    My brother thinks he's cool. He really isn't.
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li>
                    Dad
                    <br/>
                    <img src="img/dad.png" alt="dad"/>
                    <br/>
                    He's the guy who got me into coding. But he never lets me forget it. (According to him, I owe him big $$$).
                </li>
                <hr>
                <li>
                    Mom
                    <br/>
                    <img src="img/mom.png" alt="mom"/>
                    <br/>
                    Very hardworking, dedicated, and sincere... towards my brother
                </li>
                <hr/>
                <li>
                    Buggy the Bug (I didn't name him)
                    <p class="img_alt">I don't have a picture of him (or is it her?) because he/she never stays still</p>
                    One fateful day, a creepy bug flew into my house and began flying around a light. My dad tried to sneak up on it with a towel, but my brother didn't let anyone kill the bug. Now, it's practically a pet in our house.
